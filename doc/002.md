# 3. Build and Deploy Your API #

In this section, you'll first connect TIBCO Business Studio™ for BusinessWorks from your workstation to TIBCO Cloud, import a BusinessWorks project into Business Studio that implements a system API, and then deploy it to TIBCO Cloud and test it. Then you will implement a process API - that orchestrates over 3 system APIs - using Flogo, and deploy and test it.
